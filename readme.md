## Readme 

The project is to collect *good* words mainly from computer-vision papers. I believe good paper deserves good representation, to name the expressive words.

This is an interest-motivated project that initially came into my mind when I read the [Chris A. Mack, How to Write a Good Scientific Paper](https://spie.org/samples/9781510619142.pdf)
 at 2016. 
 
 You are welcome to contribute the projects with new words you like,
