\entry{imminent}{imminent}{adj.}{If you say that something is imminent, especially something unpleasant, you mean it is almost certain to happen very soon.} --- \textit{When collapse to a single mode is \textbf{imminent}, the gradient of the discriminator may point in similar directions for many similar points.}


\entry{intractable}{in-tract-able}{adj.}{If you say that a person, problem, or device is tractable, you mean that they can be easily controlled or dealt with.} --- \textit{Such models generally have \textbf{intractable} likelihood functions and therefore require numerous approximations to the likelihood gradient.}


\entry{intriguing}{intrigu-ing}{adj.}{If you describe something as intriguing, you mean that it is interesting or strange.} --- \textit{Szegedy et al first discovered an \textbf{intriguing} weakness of deep neural networks in the context of image classification.}
