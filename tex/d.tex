\section{D}

\entry{devise}{devise}{vt.}{If you devise a plan, system, or machine, you have the idea for it and design it.} --- \textit{Training could be accelerated greatly by \textbf{devising} better methods for coordinating G and D.}

\entry{differentiate}{different-i-ate}{vt.}{If you differentiate between things or if you differentiate one thing from another, you recognize or show the difference between them.} --- \textit{The generator aims to produce realistic synthetic data so that the discriminator cannot \textbf{differentiate} between real and synthetic data.}


\entry{delineate}{delineate}{vt.}{If you delineate something such as an idea or situation, you describe it or define it, often in a lot of detail.} --- \textit{We compare our objective with that of Taskonomy [42] to \textbf{delineate} the difference.}


\entry{deterministic}{determin-istic}{adj.}{Deterministic ideas or explanations are based on determinism.} --- \textit{Recently, stochastic neural networks have become popular, and \textbf{deterministic} networks are being used for image generation tasks.}
